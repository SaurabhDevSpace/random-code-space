# Data center out-of-band management

## Breakthrough simplicity and scalability

Purpose-built for modern data center demands

### The challenge

AI and cloud workloads are driving rapid data center growth. Legacy out-of-band (OOB) management networks are complex and can’t scale to support existing and future data center demands. Bulky copper cabling, limited rack space, and excessive power and cooling requirements are increasingly problematic.

### Our approach

Ciena’s data center out-of-band management (DCOM) replaces legacy OOB architectures with a streamlined, PON-based solution, easing provisioning and configuration with less equipment and less cost. This purpose-built solution combines Ciena routing platforms with innovative PON systems and control software.

### The benefits

DCOM dramatically simplifies the design, deployment, and operation of OOB management networks with a highly scalable and cost-effective solution. It centralizes network provisioning, streamlines operations, and significantly reduces rack space, power, and cooling—all without compromising performance.

## Revolutionizing data center management with PON technology

Discover how Ciena and Meta reimagined data center management using a PON-based architecture—cutting 99% of rack space, reducing power, and streamlining remote access. This white paper breaks down how hyperscalers can ditch legacy OOB for a smarter, scalable future.

Ciena has long been known as the global leader in high-speed optical networking. At the core of our approach are industry-leading coherent modem technology, versatile optical line systems, and advanced network automation tools. These solutions are widely deployed in subsea, long-haul, metro DWDM, and data center interconnect (DCI) networks of all sizes, setting the standard for modern optical networks and ensuring they can scale while reducing power and space requirements.

As we look forward, the rapid expansion of cloud services and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications have led to soaring traffic growth, beyond the typical 30% annual growth rate. We know first-hand that service, cloud, and content providers demand the highest capacity and lowest latency network architectures to underpin innovative new AI solution offerings.

We are already helping our customers meet those demands with our WaveLogic 6 Extreme (WL6e) coherent modem—the industry’s only 1.6 Tb/s single wavelength solution, integrated C&L band photonics solutions, and network control tools. In addition to these hardware and software capabilities, Ciena is also focusing on automating capacity deployment to meet the industry's demand for accelerated and error-free deployment.

At Ciena, we think big and will never stop pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Our teams aren’t slowing down on developing innovations to support traditional applications, but did you know we are leveraging the strength of our market-leading optical technology to do more? We are expanding our solutions not only to address connectivity needs for thousands of kilometers but also across a data center campus and inside the data center itself—something we like to call “in and around the data center.”

This shouldn’t surprise you because addressing the hardest networking challenges is what Ciena does best, and AI is bringing with it a pile of new challenges for us to help you tackle.

We are expanding our solutions not only to address connectivity needs for thousands of kilometers but also across a data center campus and inside the data center itself—something we like to call “in and around the data center."


###### Building on our optical strength – innovative solutions inside and around the data center

The data center space is seeing incredible growth driven in part by AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) related build-outs. AI clusters are scaling massively, rapidly growing to hundreds of thousands of interconnected xPUs (GPUs, TPUs, etc.), consuming unprecedented amounts of power, and needing a greater distribution of compute infrastructure across data centers. In response, global cloud and AI solution providers are challenging the industry to deliver innovations that enable scalable data center designs with high performance, low power, and flexible connectivity – aligning perfectly with the technology innovations Ciena provides.

Our data center strategy focuses on three key areas:

**1)** **Metro DCI (Data Center Interconnect) **

**2) Campus applications (2-20km)**

**3) Intra-Data Center applications **

Let me tell you a bit more about what we’re doing in each of these areas.

**Metro DCI**

As data centers become more distributed and the distances between them decrease, coherent pluggable transceivers deployed directly on routers offer the most space, power, and cost-efficient solution. Ciena is a leading supplier for these applications with our WaveLogic Nano portfolio, and the demand for our high-performing, best-in-class pluggables is strong and growing. Our WaveLogic 5 Nano 400G coherent pluggables are being deployed in volume today, and our WaveLogic 6 Nano 800G pluggables are currently sampling and will be generally available in the first half of this year. In addition, development for the next-generation 1600ZR pluggable solution is well underway.

**Campus applications**

As interconnect line rates increase, driven by the demands of AI, achieving the required performance and reach for optical interconnects inside and around the data center will become increasingly challenging using traditional intensity modulated direct detect (IMDD) technology. To address this, we’re introducing groundbreaking products like our 1.6T Coherent-Lite solution, offering significant performance and capacity benefits to IMDD technology, with the ability to support WDM and extend reach to 20km or more, while also providing lower latency and lowest cost per bit compared to 400ZR/800ZR pluggables. For campus applications, this provides operators with unprecedented flexibility to build and connect data centers near sustainable energy sources while maintaining optimal performance.

**Intra-data center applications**

We are planning to leverage our expertise in mixed signal design and packaging to introduce optimized 224G and 448G SerDes chiplets. These technologies provide industry-leading performance for use across both scale up and scale out AI driven applications, such as embedded xPU, xPO engines and AECs.

In fact, only Ciena has 448Gb/s PAM4 working in silicon today, powered by state-of-the-art 224GDAC (digital-to-analog) and ADC (analog-to-digital) technologies in 3nm CMOS. This achievement not only paves the way for next-generation interconnects, such as 3.2T and beyond, but also enables progress toward a more sustainable digital infrastructure.

###### Strategic solutions to unlock AI and cloud opportunities

Ciena’s strategy for addressing AI and cloud growth is more than a technological roadmap; it’s a commitment to helping service providers and cloud operators alike prepare for the opportunities presented by AI in the WAN and inside and around the data center. With our cutting-edge technology, Ciena is uniquely positioned to guide operators through this next chapter of network evolution.

Faster data rates inside cloud and AI-powered data centers require transformative technology. With Ciena's latest innovations, such as 1.6T Coherent-Lite and 448Gb/s PAM4, the company is demonstrating how its technical leadership in coherent optical technology can be directly applied to solve these emerging challenges within the data center.


In addition to showcasing our innovations to meet the growing demand for subsea, terrestrial, and metro networks, Ciena’s data center strategy was on display at OFC.

###### Here’s what we showed:

- The industry’s first 1.6Tb/s coherent solution with WL6e on our Waveserver and 6500 platforms, enabling highest capacity connectivity in all applications
- Our programmable photonic line systems supporting application-optimized configurations from edge to core, including ROADM terminal site evolution to support multi-rail deployments
- Our metro DCI solutions including WaveLogic 5 Nano 400G and WaveLogic 6 Nano 800G coherent pluggable transceivers
- The industry’s first live showcase of a 1.6T Coherent-Lite solution for campus DCI and intra-data center applications supporting 1.6 Tb/s throughput with 224G SerDes
- The industry’s first 448Gb/s PAM4 working in silicon, powered by Ciena’s ultra-high-bandwidth DAC (digital-to-analog) and ADC (analog-to-digital) converters implemented in low-power 3nm CMOS, paving the way to 3.2T interconnects. Both electrical PAM4 and optical PAM4 IMDD transmission will be demonstrated

Here is a video highlighting some of these industry first demos.

AI meets optical innovation: The future of data center networking with Ciena

Ciena is well known for our pedigree in subsea, long-haul, and metro optical networks, but what about taking our innovations in and around the data center?

Chalk Talk: Maximize your fiber capacity with L-band spectrum

In this Chalk Talk, Paul Chedore, Photonic Systems Architect, provides a detailed comparison between three options for increasing the usable spectrum: the conventional 9.6 THz C+L-band, 10.8 THz Extended C + Shifted L-band, and 12 THz Extended C-band + Extended L-band.

Episode 87: How Meta Reimagined OOB Management in the Data Center

On this episode, Mike “MJ” Joseph, who manages the infrastructure network engineering team at Meta, joins Ciena’s Mark Bieberich to discuss innovation in out-of-band (OOB) management networks, which are essential for initial device commissioning, disaster recovery, remote troubleshooting, and secure lifecycle management. MJ and Mark explore Meta's decision to adopt passive optical networking (PON) for OOB management, highlighting the collaborative effort with Ciena to create an ultra-scalable, cost effective PON-based solution. They also discuss the positive outcomes Meta has achieved by streamlining and automating its OOB network operations in the data center—and the lessons learned along the way.

CSPs are looking to use AIOps to broaden the scope of network management and improve operational efficiency at each stage of the network lifecycle, by combining big data with AI/machine learning (ML).

## What matters to us

## Our purpose

To some, humanity and technology are opposites. The more technical you get, the more you lose the human touch. And yet, at Ciena, the two go hand in hand.

We’re just as passionate about building the most advanced networks as we are about building the most meaningful relationships. Our culture is just as strongly defined by our spirit of innovation as it is by our sense of humanity. And it’s interesting what happens when you marry the two.

For us, this means open collaboration without egos. It means blurring the line between our team and our customers, so much so that we become an extension of their business and enablers of their success. It’s showing up in our communities—local and global—to celebrate differences, and power change. Because the simple truth is that when you bring your humanity into your work, you see it differently. So you build it differently. And that changes everything.

**Ciena. Bringing humanity to innovation.**

# A letter from our CEO

As our industry continues to develop transformational technologies, the network has become increasingly integral to society with the promise of fundamentally changing the way we live, work, connect, and thrive. It is with this continued evolution in mind that, as a company, we remain focused on one thing—the people with and for whom we build networks.

At Ciena, our DNA is characterized by two attributes that fuel one another: a relentless drive to innovate, and a deep sense of humanity. We are just as passionate about building the world’s most advanced networks as we are about building meaningful relationships—with customers, partners, and communities. This is the essence of who we are beyond the technology we make and the possibilities we enable. *People* are why we do what we do.

**Our purpose is to bring humanity to innovation.**

We see things differently, so we build things differently. From the beginning, our natural approach has been to cultivate a higher degree of trust and collaboration with our customers, our partners, and each other—enabling us to design networks that better serve the people who run them—and ultimately those who use them. Our ethos is evident in the depths of our customer relationships, in the way we approach solutions, in our workplace philosophies, our contributions to communities, and our commitments to sustainability.

Over the decades, our focus on people continues to drive us to do what others say is impossible. The blending of our deep humanity and relentless innovation is what sets us apart. In an industry that moves literally at the speed of light, being rooted in people means we never lose sight of what *really* matters—today and always.

**Coherent routing has seen a significant evolution over the years, particularly with the advent of the 800G ecosystem. Ciena’s Ivana Lemos reflects on key industry shifts, recent announcements, and insights from a Heavy Reading global survey.**

Can you believe how quickly the year is flying by? Time isn’t the only thing speeding up—technology advancements are moving just as fast, and the coherent routing landscape is no exception!

There’s been a flurry of activity in the industry lately, so it can be easy to miss some key developments. From new research into deployment trends, to collaborative multi-vendor interoperability testing, and new product innovations – we have been busy.

Let’s dive into the latest happenings in this space.

###### Survey pulse

We kicked off the year by taking the pulse of Communications Service Providers (CSPs) who have deployed or are planning to deploy coherent routing architectures. We also wanted to gauge how next-gen technologies, like 800G, are shaping their perspectives. To do this, we teamed up with Heavy Reading (HR) for the largest global survey of its kind. Over 240 service providers weighed in, and the results were pretty telling.

First off, coherent routing is now a big part of the network evolution playbook. In the last three years, service providers have shown steadily increasing preference for coherent pluggables in routers, with 59% of the respondents now saying their 400G+ pluggables will be housed in routers and 41% in DWDM systems by 2027.

In fact, this year’s results are a near reversal from a similar 2022 survey, which showed a 61/39% split in favor of DWDM systems.

Heavy Reading analyst Sterling Perrin sits down with Ciena’s Sr. Director of Product Line Management, Rafael Francis, and VP, Product Line Management, Tim Pearson, to review the survey findings and what they mean for the future of coherent routing in telecom.

So, while these trends clearly point to coherent routing as an architectural direction the market is heading in, what challenges are customers still facing when deploying it today?

The findings here are also clear: the software side of things is becoming increasingly important. To that end, 'operational simplicity/improving efficiency’ is the top driver for going with coherent pluggables. But the trick is making it happen, with respondents citing 'ensuring consistent operational practices between coherent pluggables from multiple vendors' as the top-listed barrier to adoption.

The writing is on the wall: without tighter operational integration between the IP and optical layers, you won’t be able to realize all the savings that coherent routing deployments can provide.

Collectively, these trends point to a growing need for end-to-end, multi-layer lifecycle management—a topic we explored in depth at MPLS & SRv6 AI Net World Congress 2025 (MPLS WC).

###### Trends and takeaways from industry events

Several industry trade shows and conferences in 2025 have spotlighted coherent routing deployment trends, converged design best practices, and the latest 800G advancements.

Let’s first look at MPLS WC, where Rafael Francis kicked off the IP/Optical track by emphasizing that coherent routing architectural decisions should be made from the very beginning, particularly during the planning phase.

To drive his point home, he shared a real-world modelling example of a Pan-European network. He demonstrated how our newly introduced multi-layer planning tools—“Capacity Compass,” and other apps within Ciena’s Navigator Network Control Suite (Navigator NCS)—help customers determine what percentage of that sample network, which consisted of 60 routes, is best served by 400G pluggables, 800G pluggables, or a 1.6T embedded modem, all hosted in routers.

The best part? With this tool, our team completed the analysis in just one hour—something that used to take customers days, if not weeks! You can watch the full video of Raf’s talk here.

So, what’s the bottom line? Make sure you have the right tools to plan for a range of architectural scenarios to unlock value, not a one-size-fits-all approach. Without this foundation, once deployments scale to real-world figures, they might not keep up with expectations.

This realization is gaining traction in our industry, as one CSP noted in one of the Heavy Reading in-depth surveys.


One major (IP over DWDM) challenge is capacity planning. When we need additional capacity between two technical sites, we have to determine what modulation to use, and which pluggable modules will work best. Previously, this process was simple—we would contact the line system vendor, request a bill of materials, and send out a purchase order. Now, we have to make those calculations ourselves.

Now with Capacity Compass, they don’t have to make those calculations themselves!

###### Faster 800G+ routers and optics on display—live!

At OFC we had a different mission: to showcase the industry's very first 1.6Tb/s router, Ciena’s WaveRouter, along with our recently introduced 800GbE router, Ciena’s 8192—both featured in live demos at an event for the first time.

The industry has been talking about 800G technology for while, and it was inspiring to see this emerging ecosystem is vibrant and expanding. In fact, the 8192 played an integral role in the OIF multi-vendor testing, demonstrating its interoperability with eight pluggable hosts—a mix of 400ZR/ZR+, 800ZR, and 800G OpenROADM PCS—across two third-party line systems. You can see the OIF topology details and watch the 8192 in action here.

On the forecasting side, our survey report found that CSPs' interest in 800G pluggables and 800G-capable routers was among the top climbing stats.

Attendees also got a sneak peek at our flagship router, the WaveRouter, featuring its new WaveLogic 6 Extreme subslot module, transporting a beautifully formed 1.6Tbps channel.

With these additions, Ciena’s coherent routing is the only solution that integrates 400G, 800G, and 1.6T DWDM within a router, allowing you to cover even more applications—including submarine—with a converged design.

###### All-in-one multi-layer tool

We headed back to our Ottawa campus for our bi-annual Vectors event, which draws customers from all over the globe.

The mission? Build on the demo lineup from MPLS WC, spotlighting how far we’ve come in integrating our coherent routing solution with the Navigator NCS multi-layer provisioning, protection, and management workflows—all using one tool and streamlined processes.

Operational simplicity comes front and center, but we have also been demonstrating how our solution drives infrastructure ROI. Put simply, our toolset sweats the optical infrastructure assets to mine 'free capacity' for router links using Ciena’s Liquid Spectrum software.

Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and many customers left confident that they’re investing in a multi-generational technology partnership, not just a point product.

###### From demos to deals

Whether you look at survey findings or the vibrant industry ecosystem, one thing is clear: coherent routing is on the rise.

Our team is proud to be part of this momentum. We now have hundreds of Coherent Routing customers—and counting. Plus, we’ve recently published four new customer references. We are grateful for partnerships like this, where shared vision meets real execution.

**29% of CSPs believe AI will contribute more than half of long-haul traffic over the next three years Just 16% of CSPs’ optical networks are “very ready” for AI**

Ciena and Heavy Reading (now part of Omdia) recently launched a global survey to better understand the impacts of AI applications and traffic growth on metro and long-haul networks operated by communications service providers (CSPs), including fixed, mobile, and converged network operators and cable operators.

The report found that CSPs expect significant traffic demand from AI in their metro networks over the next three years, with 18% expecting AI to contribute more than half of their total metro network traffic, and nearly half (49%) expecting AI will exceed 30% of metro traffic. When it comes to long-haul traffic, CSPs have even higher expectations for AI. While just over half (52%) believe AI will exceed 30%, nearly one-third (29%) believe that AI will contribute more than half of long-haul traffic over the next three years.

“This research highlights the rapid rise of AI applications — from large-scale models to cloud AI services and edge-to-core workflows — that are set to become major drivers of both local and long-haul network traffic,” said Sterling Perrin, Sr. Principal Analyst, Heavy Reading – now part of Omdia.* “*For metro networks, where AI will compete with video, web, and IoT traffic, the projected growth is striking. With AI expected to take an even larger share of long-haul capacity within three years, it’s clear that AI data flows, including those used for training and inference, will put unprecedented demands on CSP networks.”

**Connectivity services for AI traffic **

The survey found that CSPs expect to play a much broader role in AI connectivity as the market matures, particularly in serving enterprise customers with high bandwidth wavelength services at 100G, 400G, and even 800G data rates.

- 50% of respondents ranked high-bandwidth wavelength services as top in a list of services expected to grow the most from AI over the next three years.
- By comparison, just 25% of respondents expect dark fiber to grow the most due to AI.
- 74% of CSPs expect enterprise customers to drive the most traffic growth on their networks over the next three years, ahead of hyperscalers and cloud providers.

**Challenges to optical network readiness for AI **

The survey indicates a broad mix of challenges standing in the way of taking advantage of the AI traffic boom. Globally, the top challenges include capex constraints (38%), go-to-market/business strategies (38%), and network management (32%).

While 16% of CSPs surveyed believe their optical networks are “very ready” for AI, most recognize there is still work to be done when it comes to their optical networks’ readiness to support AI network demands. 39% report their networks are “ready,” with “much of the network in place but still some work to do”, 40% reported that they are just “somewhat ready” with much work remaining, and 5% reported their optical networks are not ready at all.

The report is based on a custom survey of 77 CSPs, fielded globally by Informa TechTarget in February 2025. Read the full Optical Transport Networks for AI report here. You can also access a webinar here.

Where your Personal Data is stored in backup archives, your Personal Data will be deleted or destroyed in accordance with our general deletion routines (and be securely stored so that it is isolated from any further processing until deletion, destruction, or anonymization has been completed). We will not attempt to re-identify Personal Data that has been anonymized.
